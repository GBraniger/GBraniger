- 👋 Hi, I’m @GBraniger
- 👀 I’m interested in Sports Officiating and building apps to help me track my game assignments, Game Fee tracking and milage, and issues.  Just a geek who is into sports officiating.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JAVA and all that goes with it.  I have spent 20+ years as a Mainframe Developer in COBOL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help on.  But honestly I am pretty green to the non-mainframe world.
- 📫 How to reach me GBraniger@gmail.com
